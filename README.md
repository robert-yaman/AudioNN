Although kind of basic caryover, image recognition and music transcription both lend themselves to convolutional structures. In image recognition you might to pick out some quality of a grid of pixels in order to determine whether or not this is a cat. Similarly, in music transcription, you most likely need access to info to a large spectrum of frequencies in order to determine whether a note is sounding. This seems like a good way to distinguish fundamental frequencies with (overtone)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtone] - if a frequency is not accompanied by another softer frequency 18 steps up, it is likely not fundmanetal.
